The friction factor f for straight sections is governed by the Colebrook-White equation. Since this equation is implicit (the variable f appears on both sides), it cannot be solved algebraically and requires numerical iteration
To initialize the Newton-Raphson iteration, a high-accuracy seed value (f0) was generated using the explicit Swamee-Jain equation f0 =
